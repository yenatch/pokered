# Contextual field moves in Pokémon Red and Blue

This mod implements the behavior of field moves in later Pokémon titles. They can be used by talking to relevant objects (like water, trees, or boulders).

The player is given all badges and some toys to play with as an example.

This is a minor hack. It's based on [pokered][pokered].
